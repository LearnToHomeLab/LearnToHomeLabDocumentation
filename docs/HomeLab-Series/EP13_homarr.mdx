[EP 22 - Homarr 1.0 Install/Upgrade:](/HomeLab-Series/EP22_homarr1.0upgrade.mdx)

## Introduction

In this episode we are going to cover how to install the Homarr Dashboard. Homarr is a dashboard that helps you manage your server by providing access to all your apps and services in one place. It's highly customizable and integrates with self-hosted applications.

<div style={{
  display: 'flex',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  alignItems: 'center',
  height: '100%',
}}>

The following commands will work with EITHER a Proxmox VM or Proxmox container!
</InfoBox>

## Getting Started

The first thing you will need to do is create a Proxmox VM or container. Please see the image below with the example of the configuration we used for our Homarr Vm.

If you want to know where I got the commands shown in the video, they are from the following/trial and error:

## How to Install Homarr

After creating your VM/container, SSH into your about to be Homarr Machine. 

<DocImage folder="images/EP13_homarr" name="Still 2025-01-13 155148_1.3.2.png" alt="Description of your image" />

Now we are going to start installing all the packages (Docker, Docker Compose, and Homarr). 

<DocImage folder="images/EP13_homarr" name="Still 2025-01-13 155148_1.3.3.png" alt="Description of your image" />

### Installing Docker

Adding the GPG keys and Docker repo:
```
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

Install the Latest Package:
```
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

Ensure Docker is running after Install, you will get a response like this.
```
sudo docker run hello-world
```

<DocImage folder="images/EP13_homarr" name="docker hello response_1.3.1.png" alt="Description of your image" />

#### If Docker hello fails do the following

if you do not get a response try
```
systemctl status docker.service
```
If that shows failed messages, try the following
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
Then try to see its status once again:
```
systemctl status docker.service
```
<DocImage folder="images/EP13_homarr" name="docker status_1.3.2.png" alt="Description of your image" />

### Install Docker Compose

Install Docker Compose with:
```
sudo apt install docker-compose
```
Verify that docker compose is installed
```
docker compose version
```

<DocImage folder="images/EP13_homarr" name="docker compose version number_1.3.3.png" alt="Description of your image" />

## Install Homarr

Then create a docker compose file:
```
nano docker-compose.yml
```
Copy the following file config in there from Homarr
```
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
#     Homarr - A simple, yet powerful dashboard for your server.      #
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
services:
  homarr:
    container_name: homarr
    image: ghcr.io/ajnart/homarr:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock # Optional, only if you want docker integration
      - ./homarr/configs:/app/data/configs
      - ./homarr/icons:/app/public/icons
      - ./homarr/data:/data
    ports:
      - '7575:7575'
```

<DocImage folder="images/EP13_homarr" name="Still 2025-01-13 155148_1.3.4.png" alt="Description of your image" />

Then run the following to start it:
```
sudo docker compose up -d
```
Then to login to your machine you will type the following into your browser to access the panel:
```
ip_address:7575
```

After you go to the site you will be presented with this screen, make a username and matching password.

<DocImage folder="images/EP13_homarr" name="Still 2025-01-13 155148_1.3.5.png" alt="Description of your image" />

To edit the dashboard you will select the following icon from the top right

<DocImage folder="images/EP13_homarr" name="edit homarr dashboard_1.3.4.png" alt="Description of your image" />

You will then be presented with the options APPS / WIDGETS / CATEGORIES. APPS are used to connect VMs, containers, etc. as hyperlinks so we can access those sites/resources quickly.

<DocImage folder="images/EP13_homarr" name="dashboard homarr options_1.3.5.png" alt="Description of your image" />

When adding VMs, Containers, or other services you will use the IP address and the port number for both the internal and external address sections after selecting the APP option.

```
sudo systemctl stop docker
```
Restart:
```
sudo systemctl restart docker

Check the status:
```
sudo systemctl status docker
```
and start docker compose:
```
sudo docker compose up -d
```
