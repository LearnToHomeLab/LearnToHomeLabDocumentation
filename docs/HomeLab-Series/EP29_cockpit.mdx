## Manage Linux Servers With Cockpit

Start by creating an Ubuntu Linux Server in your virtualization platform of choice (this tutorial uses Proxmox). Download the latest Ubuntu Server [here](https://releases.ubuntu.com/). Example: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.

## Update Ubuntu Server

First, update all packages before installation:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Reference documentation [here](https://cockpit-project.org/running.html).

## Installing Cockpit

The Cockpit repository is usually enabled by default. Update packages then install Cockpit:
```
. /etc/os-release
sudo apt install -t ${VERSION_CODENAME}-backports cockpit
```

Access Cockpit by visiting in your browser:
```
https://IP_ADDRESS_OF_MACHINE:9090
```

## Software Tab

Use the Software tab in Cockpit to perform any missing updates before continuing.

## Fix Cache Whilst Offline Error

If you see “Cannot download packages whilst offline,” fix it with steps from the [Cockpit FAQ](https://cockpit-project.org/faq.html#error-message-about-being-offline):

1. Edit config:
```
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/10-globally-managed-devices.conf
```
Add:
```
[keyfile]
unmanaged-devices=none
```

2. Set up a dummy network interface:
```
sudo nmcli con add type dummy con-name fake ifname fake0 ip4 1.2.3.4/24 gw4 1.2.3.1
```
Reboot:
```
sudo reboot
```
